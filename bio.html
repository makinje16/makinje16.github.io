    <p>Current University student with a passion for coding and game design.
        Fluent in C++ and C#. My dream is to eventually start my own indie game company.
        Obviously I will need more experience, but I'll get there at some point.</p>

    <p> I grew up on the Lower East side of New York City. I started coding during hichschool
        and from there I fell in love with it. I grew up playing games and my online communities
        are ones I still feel ties to today no matter what age I am. I can play a game once,
        but as long as I played it and added value to that community in any form, I could come back
        to it years later and feel just a part of it.
        That is why I love games and wish to make them myself.
        I believe that games can bring people together and foster a community closer
        than the ones around you at time.</p>
